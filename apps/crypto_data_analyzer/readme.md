# ⚡ Quick Start Guide

## 1️⃣ Connect to Your TimescaleDB (Tiger Cloud or Local)

* **Option 1:** Use Tiger Cloud SQL Editor
* **Option 2:** Connect with `psql`:

```bash
psql "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>"
```

---

## 2️⃣ Create the Hypertable for Real-Time Crypto Data

* Review the schema setup in:

```bash
apps/crypto_sample/schema_setup.sql
```

Run the SQL commands inside to create the optimized hypertable structure.

---

## 3️⃣ Load Financial Tick Data

* Download the dataset:

[🌐 Download Crypto Dataset (crypto\_sample.zip)](https://docs.tigerdata.com/tutorials/latest/financial-tick-data/financial-tick-dataset/)

* Extract the `.csv` files into your local project directory under `apps/crypto_sample/`

* Load the data using:

```sql
\COPY crypto_sample FROM 'apps/crypto_sample/tutorial_sample_tick.csv' CSV HEADER;
\COPY company FROM 'apps/crypto_sample/tutorial_sample_assets.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

**⚠️ Note:** Loading millions of rows may take several minutes, depending on system resources.

# 📊 Connect Grafana for Real-Time Dashboards

1. Open Grafana in your browser:

   * **Self-hosted:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
     *(Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`)*

2. Add TimescaleDB as a new data source:

   * Go to: `Connections → Data Sources → Add new`
   * Select **PostgreSQL**
   * Configure with your TimescaleDB connection details:

```
Host: <host>:<port>
Database: <database-name>
Username: <username>
Password: <password>
```

* **TLS/SSL Mode:** `require`
* **PostgreSQL Options:** Enable `TimescaleDB`

3. Click `Save & Test` to confirm your connection is working.
